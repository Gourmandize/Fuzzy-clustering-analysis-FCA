# Fuzzy-clustering-analysis-FCA
The FCA program is constructed using the PyQt5 GUI interface, with the main_run.py file serving as the main program. The function_lib.py file serves as the function library for the main program. After saving in the main program, a text file and an image file will be saved in the output folder. The classification results for each threshold are recorded in the text file.

The remaining three XLSX files contain the data used in the study.
