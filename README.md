# Fuzzy-clustering-analysis-FCA
The FCA program is constructed using the PyQt5 GUI interface, with the main_run.py file serving as the main program. The function_lib.py file serves as the function library for the main program. After saving in the main program, a text file and an image file will be saved in the output folder. The classification results for each threshold are recorded in the text file.

The data_test.xlsx file is an example of input data. The remaining three XLSX files were used in the article's research. The output file contains the results obtained from the component data analysis of the manuscript.

The specific procedure is to first open the file, then select the calibration method, enter the number of classes, and finally click the Start button.

Note: The final images in the manuscript were further processed using OriginPro software.
